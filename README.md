# Think Fast Chuckle Nuts

## What is TFCN?
A BetterDiscord Plugin that adds a bright flash of light covering your Discord window when you get a notification.
Discord notifications don't grab your attention enough? Default ping sound doesn't really annoy you?
Flashbang is the solution.

Made this for fun in my spare time. It's kind of a sh^tpost plugin lacking any real useful features, more suited as a novelty. Up to you to interpret.

## Why TFCN
Think Fast Chuckle Nuts comes from the TF2 meme format where Scout exclaims "Think Fast Chuckle Nuts!" before throwing a flashbang at your screen. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOhmcbfwxnA&ab_channel=BrinsoTheFox)
