# Think Fast Chuckle Nuts

Tired of boring Discord notifications? Not annoying you enough? 

You better think fast chuckle nuts, because every time that annoying mod DMs you about server indecency, you'll be served with a flashbang

Every time you receive a notification, a bright flash of light momentarily covers your screen.
Flash duration is configurable. DND disables the effect.

Made this for fun in my spare time, it's a shitpost plugin.
