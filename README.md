# Think Fast Chuckle Nuts

A BetterDiscord Plugin that adds a bright flash of light every time you get a notification

Tired of boring Discord notifications? Not annoying you enough? 
You better think fast chuckle nuts, because every time that annoying mod DMs you about server indecency, you'll be served with a flashbang

Made this for fun in my spare time, it's basically a shitpost plugin.

Configurable Options:
- Flash Duration; How long the flash will stay on your screen before dissipating
- Enable on DND; Enable flash effect while on DND
- Blacklist Options; TBA
